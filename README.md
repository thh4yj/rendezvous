<strong>A note about this code sample:</strong> Because the original repository is locked by my former professor, I had to create a clone. This project has not been maintained since November 2020 and as such certain features such as google maps and image loading are no longer functional. I specificlly implemented Google login, event edit, event delete, event search, event RSVP, and undo RSVP.

To use this service, you must have a google account. Events can be viewed without an account,
but to use any functionality, an account is required. 

All major sources consulted are cited properly in the source files. Any quick reference
sources are cited inline.
